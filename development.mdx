## IDENTIFICATION AND CLASSIFICATION OF PERSONAL DATA

- 
  1. The ADNOC Group must keep accurate and up-to-date records of these Processing activities within its Personal Data Registers which must be prepared, maintained and updated regularly by the relevant business team Processing Personal Data in consultation with the E&C team or the DPO.
  2. Personal Data Registers must include the following information:

1. the name and contact details of the Data Controller (see section 7 below for further details) and, where appointed, the DPO;
2. the purposes and legal basis of the Processing;
3. the categories and sources of the Personal Data;
4. the categories of recipients to whom the Personal Data has been or will be disclosed;
5. the security measures applied to the Personal Data; and

   2. Sensitive Personal Data in electronic format must be classified and secured as Level 4 'Restricted' or higher depending on its sensitivity and risk factors, as well as specific handling and data security requirements defined by the applicable laws and regulations.

## COLLECTION AND PROCESSING OF PERSONAL DATA

- 
  1. The ADNOC Group collects and uses Personal Data about Data Subjects including ADNOC Group Personnel, customers, suppliers and visitors to the ADNOC Group's premises or websites in line with the guiding principles set out in the Standard. Examples of Personal Data Processing activities carried out by the ADNOC Group include the following:

 1. **Customers, suppliers and strategic partners:** Undertaking due diligence (including complying with due diligence, sanctions, and anti-money laundering requirements), to maintain and service relevant contracts (including verifying the identity and authority of Data Subjects providing the ADNOC Group with commercial instructions), or to ensure the ADNOC Group meet its licensing and membership obligations (including monitoring of communications channels).
 2. **Users of ADNOC Group services and website:** Processing the completion of forms, emails, enquiries and requests, or where it is provided as part of a Data Subjects' electronic use of our website, services or platforms and emails.
 3. **Visitors to ADNOC Group premises:** Complying with security, access, and safety obligations.
 4. **Job applications, current or former employees, contractors, dependants or other employees' relatives:** Where the ADNOC Group may collect Personal Data, including Sensitive Personal Data, to facilitate employment, payroll, healthcare, insurance, visas, travel, and other regular business activities.
    1. All ADNOC Group Processing of Personal Data shall be carried out in compliance with all relevant obligations which are imposed by the relevant Personal Data Protection Regulations.
    2. A lawful basis must be identified for each Personal Data Processing activity, which should be determined during the collection of information in consultation with the relevant E&C team or a DPO and recorded in the Personal Data Register. The correct lawful basis which may be relied upon will depend on a number of factors including whether the Personal Data being Processed is Sensitive Personal Data and which Personal Data Protection Regulations apply. Depending on where the Personal Data is located, the commonly relied upon (but not exhaustive) lawful bases for Processing Personal Data may include:
 5. **Legitimate Interest** - Processing is necessary for the purposes of legitimate interests pursued by the ADNOC Group or by a third party (except where such interests are overridden by the interests or rights of the Data Subject which require protection of Personal Data);
 6. **Consent** – the Data Subject has given consent (which can be withdrawn at any time, so it may not be appropriate to rely on as explained below at section 5);
 7. **Contract** – Processing is necessary for the performance of a contract to which the Data Subject is a party;
 8. **Legal Obligation** – Processing is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which the ADNOC Group is subject under applicable law;
 9. **Legal Rights –** Processing is necessary to establish, exercise or defend ADNOC Group's legal rights or for the purpose of legal proceedings; or
10. **Vital Interests –** Processing is necessary to protect the vital interests (i.e., matters of life and death) of the Data Subject or of another natural person.
    1. In the context of Processing activities by the ADNOC Group which involve Sensitive Personal Data (such as assisting with ADNOC Group Personnel's medical, insurance or visa applications):
11. It must be clear which obligations and specific rights of the ADNOC Group or Data Subject require such collection or Processing; and
12. Where required by applicable Personal Data Protection Regulations, an additional lawful basis or condition for Processing the Sensitive Personal Data must be identified (such as explicit consent by the Data Subject).
    1. For further guidance on what constitutes Sensitive Personal Data, please refer to Appendix 1.
    2. Where Personal Data is Processed in the context of the ADNOC Group's procurement, development, deployment or use of AI systems (such as where Personal Data is used to train an AI system or where an AI system is being used to Process Personal Data), then these Processing activities may also require a lawful basis under Personal Data Protection Regulations. Since AI systems may Process Personal Data using unconventional methods and with difficult-to-foresee outcomes, separate lawful bases may apply depending on the use cases and applicable jurisdiction. Refer to the relevant E&C team or the DPO for further guidance.

## CONSENT

- 
  1. The conditions for relying on consent vary in different jurisdictions, but in general, if consent is relied on to justify using a person's Personal Data, each of the following criteria should be satisfied:

1. The consent must be limited to specific Processing activities;
2. The Data Subject must have been informed about the Processing activities in sufficient detail so as to be able to fully understand what they are consenting to;
3. The consent must be "freely given" (i.e. the Data Subject must have a genuine free choice as to whether they give the consent);
4. The performance of a contract cannot be made conditional upon the Data Subject giving their consent to the Processing, unless the Processing is required in order to perform the contract or deliver the service;
5. The consent must be given by way of an unambiguous statement or some other clear, active communication by the Data Subject, such as signing a form. Consent cannot be inferred from silence or inactivity (for example, the use of pre-ticked boxes);
6. The consent to the Processing of Personal Data must be clearly distinguished from other matters that the Data Subject is asked to agree to (for example, it should not be buried within the terms of a broader contract that the Data Subject is asked to sign); and
7. Appropriate and proportionate measures should be implemented to assess the ongoing validity of the consent.
   1. A Data Subject has the right to withdraw their consent at any time, and it must be as easy for a Data Subject to withdraw consent as it was for them to provide it in the first place. There must be appropriate processes in place to promptly action any withdrawal of consent. Consent may need to be refreshed if one intends to Process Personal Data for a different and incompatible purpose which was not disclosed when the Data Subject first consented. The Data Subject should be provided with the contact details, e.g. an email address, to which the Data Subject may direct any queries and such requests.
   2. For Sensitive Personal Data, explicit consent must be obtained which normally requires a signed statement (rather than implied consent) unless there is another lawful basis for the Processing, such as a legal obligation, a vital interest or a public interest.
   3. For Personal Data which is Processed by an AI system, depending on the context, obtaining a Data Subject's explicit consent may be appropriate provided that the criteria set out above at section 5.1 are satisfied.
   4. A record of consents should be retained by the ADNOC Group to evidence that it has been authorised to carry out the Processing of a Data Subject's Personal Data.

## PRIVACY NOTICE REQUIREMENTS

- 
  1. Depending on the applicable Personal Data Protection Regulations the information to be provided to the Data Subject about Processing should include the following:

 1. The identity and contact details of the ADNOC Group and the DPO;
 2. The categories of Personal Data collected in relation to the Data Subject;
 3. If the Personal Data is not obtained from the Data Subject, the source(s) of the Personal Data;
 4. The purpose(s) for which Personal Data will be Processed, including the lawful basis for the Processing (see section 4.3 above). If the lawful basis involves "legitimate interests", a description of those legitimate interests must also be provided;
 5. If Personal Data is Processed based on the Data Subject's consent, an explanation of the Data Subject's right to withdraw their consent at any time;
 6. The categories of Personal Data that may be disclosed to third parties and the reasons for these disclosures;
 7. If the Processing is a contractual requirement, whether the Data Subject is obliged to provide the Personal Data on that basis, and the possible consequences of a failure to provide the information;
 8. Any intention to transfer the Personal Data and information about the level of protection that will be given to the transfer (including details of how the legal and regulatory requirements for the transfer will be satisfied);
 9. Information about the existence of any automated decision making (for example, profiling or through AI systems) undertaken by the ADNOC Group based on the Personal Data, including details of the logic involved and its impact on the Data Subject;
10. The period for which the Personal Data will be retained, or (if it is not possible to provide a specific time period) the criteria that will be used to determine the retention period;
11. A general description of ADNOC Group's policies and practices with respect to protecting the confidentiality and security of Personal Data;
12. The existence of the Data Subject's rights and the ways and methods through which rights can be exercised; and
13. Any other information that is necessary to guarantee that the Processing of the Personal Data is fair in the circumstances.

## DATA PROCESSORS AND DATA CONTROLLERS

- 
  1. The terms Data Controller and Data Processor are set out in the relevant Personal Data Protection Regulations, but in general:

1. Data Controller is the natural or legal person who determines the purpose for collecting Personal Data and how it will be used, stored and Processed, or more commonly the 'why' and 'how' Personal Data should be Processed.
2. Data Processor is the natural or legal person who then Processes Personal Data on behalf of the Data Controller (i.e. they comply, and only Process the Personal Data in accordance with the Data Controller's instructions).
   1. The ADNOC Group may act as either a Data Controller or Data Processor. In most cases, the ADNOC Group will act as Data Controller, for example where collecting customer, supplier or ADNOC Group Personnel Personal Data. Where such Personal Data is provided to a supplier (e.g. for payroll purposes) then the ADNOC Group will typically continue to act as a Data Controller and the supplier will typically be acting as the ADNOC Group's Data Processor.
   2. Different entities within the ADNOC Group may also be Data Controllers or Data Processors. Certain ADNOC Group entities may act as Data Processor where they perform functions for the benefit of another ADNOC Group company, for example where one ADNOC Group company relies on another for its shared human capital processes.
   3. As a Data Controller, the ADNOC Group will always remain responsible for the Personal Data it collects. The ADNOC Group is also responsible for ensuring that any Data Processor appointed to Process Personal Data on its behalf is also complying with the applicable Personal Data Protection Regulations, and the ADNOC Group remains accountable should they fail to meet their obligations.
