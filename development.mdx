If such standards and procedures conflict with this Procedure, that conflict should be notified to and approved by Group Ethics & Compliance.
  3. Capitalised terms not defined herein have the meaning given to them in the Standard available on ONE Compliance ([<u>https://compliance.adnoc.ae</u>](https://compliance.adnoc.ae/)).

## IDENTIFICATION AND CLASSIFICATION OF PERSONAL DATA

- 
  1. The ADNOC Group must keep accurate and up-to-date records of these Processing activities within its Personal Data Registers which must be prepared, maintained and updated regularly by the relevant business team Processing Personal Data in consultation with the E&C team or the DPO.
  2. Personal Data Registers must include the following information:

1. the name and contact details of the Data Controller (see section 7 below for further details) and, where appointed, the DPO;
2. the purposes and legal basis of the Processing;
3. the categories and sources of the Personal Data;
4. the categories of recipients to whom the Personal Data has been or will be disclosed;
5. the security measures applied to the Personal Data; and
6. any transfers of Personal Data to third parties, if any (including the purpose of the data transfer and any transfer mechanisms and safeguards).
   1. In accordance with the ADNOC Group Digital Information Classification Standard, where applicable, Personal Data in electronic format must be classified and secured as Level 3 ‘Need-to-Know’ or higher level of classification, depending on its sensitivity and risk factors, as well as specific handling and data security requirements defined by the applicable laws and regulations.
   2. Sensitive Personal Data in electronic format must be classified and secured as Level 4 ‘Restricted’ or higher depending on its sensitivity and risk factors, as well as specific handling and data security requirements defined by the applicable laws and regulations.

## COLLECTION AND PROCESSING OF PERSONAL DATA

- 
  1. The ADNOC Group collects and uses Personal Data about Data Subjects including ADNOC Group Personnel, customers, suppliers and visitors to the ADNOC Group’s premises or websites in line with the guiding principles set out in the Standard. Examples of Personal Data Processing activities carried out by the ADNOC Group include the following:

 1. **Customers, suppliers and strategic partners: **Undertaking due diligence (including complying with due diligence, sanctions, and anti-money laundering requirements), to maintain and service relevant contracts (including verifying the identity and authority of Data Subjects providing the ADNOC Group with commercial instructions), or to ensure the ADNOC Group meet its licensing and membership obligations (including monitoring of communications channels).
 2. **Users of ADNOC Group services and website: **Processing the completion of forms, emails, enquiries and requests, or where it is provided as part of a Data Subjects’ electronic use of our website, services or platforms and emails.
 3. **Visitors to ADNOC Group premises: **Complying with security, access, and safety obligations.
 4. **Job applications, current or former employees, contractors, dependants or other employees’ relatives: **Where the ADNOC Group may collect Personal Data, including Sensitive Personal Data, to facilitate employment, payroll, healthcare, insurance, visas, travel, and other regular business activities.
    1. All ADNOC Group Processing of Personal Data shall be carried out in compliance with all relevant obligations which are imposed by the relevant Personal Data Protection Regulations.
    2. A lawful basis must be identified for each Personal Data Processing activity, which should be determined during the collection of information in consultation with the relevant E&C team or a DPO and recorded in the Personal Data Register. The correct lawful basis which may be relied upon will depend on a number of factors including whether the Personal Data being Processed is Sensitive Personal Data and which Personal Data Protection Regulations apply. Depending on where the Personal Data is located, the commonly relied upon (but not exhaustive) lawful bases for Processing Personal Data may include:
 5. **Legitimate Interest **- Processing is necessary for the purposes of legitimate interests pursued by the ADNOC Group or by a third party (except where such interests are overridden by the interests or rights of the Data Subject which require protection of Personal Data);
 6. **Consent **– the Data Subject has given consent (which can be withdrawn at any time, so it may not be appropriate to rely on as explained below at section 5);
 7. **Contract **– Processing is necessary for the performance of a contract to which the Data Subject is a party;
 8. **Legal Obligation **– Processing is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which the ADNOC Group is subject under applicable law;
 9. **Legal Rights – **Processing is necessary to establish, exercise or defend ADNOC Group’s legal rights or for the purpose of legal proceedings; or
10. **Vital Interests – **Processing is necessary to protect the vital interests (i.e., matters of life and death) of the Data Subject or of another natural person.
    1. In the context of Processing activities by the ADNOC Group which involve Sensitive Personal Data (such as assisting with ADNOC Group Personnel’s medical, insurance or visa applications):
11. It must be clear which obligations and specific rights of the ADNOC Group or Data Subject require such collection or Processing; and
12. Where required by applicable Personal Data Protection Regulations, an additional lawful basis or condition for Processing the Sensitive Personal Data must be identified (such as explicit consent by the Data Subject).
    1. For further guidance on what constitutes Sensitive Personal Data, please refer to Appendix 1.
    2. Where Personal Data is Processed in the context of the ADNOC Group’s procurement, development, deployment or use of AI systems (such as where Personal Data is used to train an AI system or where an AI system is being used to Process Personal Data), then these Processing activities may also require a lawful basis under Personal Data Protection Regulations. Since AI systems may Process Personal Data using unconventional methods and with difficult-to-foresee outcomes, separate lawful bases may apply depending on the use cases and applicable jurisdiction. Refer to the relevant E&C team or the DPO for further guidance.

## CONSENT

- 
  1. The conditions for relying on consent vary in different jurisdictions, but in general, if consent is relied on to justify using a person’s Personal Data, each of the following criteria should be satisfied:

1. The consent must be limited to specific Processing activities;
2. The Data Subject must have been informed about the Processing activities in sufficient detail so as to be able to fully understand what they are consenting to;
3. The consent must be “freely given” (i.e. the Data Subject must have a genuine free choice as to whether they give the consent);
4. The performance of a contract cannot be made conditional upon the Data Subject giving their consent to the Processing, unless the Processing is required in order to perform the contract or deliver the service;
5. The consent must be given by way of an unambiguous statement or some other clear, active communication by the Data Subject, such as signing a form. Consent cannot be inferred from silence or inactivity (for example, the use of pre-ticked boxes);
6. The consent to the Processing of Personal Data must be clearly distinguished from other matters that the Data Subject is asked to agree to (for example, it should not be buried within the terms of a broader contract that the Data Subject is asked to sign); and
7. Appropriate and proportionate measures should be implemented to assess the ongoing validity of the consent.
   1. A Data Subject has the right to withdraw their consent at any time, and it must be as easy for a Data Subject to withdraw consent as it was for them to provide it in the first place. There must be appropriate processes in place to promptly action any withdrawal of consent. Consent may need to be refreshed if one intends to Process Personal Data for a different and incompatible purpose which was not disclosed when the Data Subject first consented. The Data Subject should be provided with the contact details, e.g. an email address, to which the Data Subject may direct any queries and such requests.
   2. For Sensitive Personal Data, explicit consent must be obtained which normally requires a signed statement (rather than implied consent) unless there is another lawful basis for the Processing, such as a legal obligation, a vital interest or a public interest.
   3. For Personal Data which is Processed by an AI system, depending on the context, obtaining a Data Subject’s explicit consent may be appropriate provided that the criteria set out above at section 5.1 are satisfied.
   4. A record of consents should be retained by the ADNOC Group to evidence that it has been authorised to carry out the Processing of a Data Subject’s Personal Data.

## PRIVACY NOTICE REQUIREMENTS

- 
  1. Depending on the applicable Personal Data Protection Regulations the information to be provided to the Data Subject about Processing should include the following:

 1. The identity and contact details of the ADNOC Group and the DPO;
 2. The categories of Personal Data collected in relation to the Data Subject;
 3. If the Personal Data is not obtained from the Data Subject, the source(s) of the Personal Data;
 4. The purpose(s) for which Personal Data will be Processed, including the lawful basis for the Processing (see section 4.3 above). If the lawful basis involves “legitimate interests”, a description of those legitimate interests must also be provided;
 5. If Personal Data is Processed based on the Data Subject’s consent, an explanation of the Data Subject’s right to withdraw their consent at any time;
 6. The categories of Personal Data that may be disclosed to third parties and the reasons for these disclosures;
 7. If the Processing is a contractual requirement, whether the Data Subject is obliged to provide the Personal Data on that basis, and the possible consequences of a failure to provide the information;
 8. Any intention to transfer the Personal Data and information about the level of protection that will be given to the transfer (including details of how the legal and regulatory requirements for the transfer will be satisfied);
 9. Information about the existence of any automated decision making (for example, profiling or through AI systems) undertaken by the ADNOC Group based on the Personal Data, including details of the logic involved and its impact on the Data Subject;
10. The period for which the Personal Data will be retained, or (if it is not possible to provide a specific time period) the criteria that will be used to determine the retention period;
11. A general description of ADNOC Group’s policies and practices with respect to protecting the confidentiality and security of Personal Data;
12. The existence of the Data Subject’s rights and the ways and methods through which rights can be exercised; and
13. Any other information that is necessary to guarantee that the Processing of the Personal Data is fair in the circumstances.

## DATA PROCESSORS AND DATA CONTROLLERS

- 
  1. The terms Data Controller and Data Processor are set out in the relevant Personal Data Protection Regulations, but in general:

1. Data Controller is the natural or legal person who determines the purpose for collecting Personal Data and how it will be used, stored and Processed, or more commonly the ‘why’ and ‘how’ Personal Data should be Processed.
2. Data Processor is the natural or legal person who then Processes Personal Data on behalf of the Data Controller (i.e. they comply, and only Process the Personal Data in accordance with the Data Controller’s instructions).
   1. The ADNOC Group may act as either a Data Controller or Data Processor. In most cases, the ADNOC Group will act as Data Controller, for example where collecting customer, supplier or ADNOC Group Personnel Personal Data. Where such Personal Data is provided to a supplier (e.g. for payroll purposes) then the ADNOC Group will typically continue to act as a Data Controller and the supplier will typically be acting as the ADNOC Group’s Data Processor.
   2. Different entities within the ADNOC Group may also be Data Controllers or Data Processors. Certain ADNOC Group entities may act as Data Processor where they perform functions for the benefit of another ADNOC Group company, for example where one ADNOC Group company relies on another for its shared human capital processes.
   3. As a Data Controller, the ADNOC Group will always remain responsible for the Personal Data it collects. The ADNOC Group is also responsible for ensuring that any Data Processor appointed to Process Personal Data on its behalf is also complying with the applicable Personal Data Protection Regulations, and the ADNOC Group remains accountable should they fail to meet their obligations.

## DATA PROTECTION IMPACT ASSESSMENT

- 
  1. Where Processing of Personal Data is likely to result in a high risk to the confidentiality and privacy of Data Subjects, a Data Protection Impact Assessment must be carried out by the business team proposing or carrying out the Processing in consultation with the E&C team or the DPO.
  2. The Personal Data Protection Regulations do not, in every case, specify what constitutes “high risk” Processing activities. However, “high risk” Processing activities will include situations where the ADNOC Group:

1. Uses new or emerging technologies that would pose a high risk to the privacy and confidentiality of Data Subjects;
2. Uses systematic and extensive profiling with significant effects;
3. Collects or Processes Sensitive Personal Data on a large scale;
4. Systematically monitors publicly accessible places on a large scale (e.g CCTV); and/or
5. Carries out any automated Processing (including profiling).
   1. Development, testing, validation, deployment, use and monitoring of AI systems is likely to involve a type of Processing that may result in a “high risk” to Data Subjects’ rights and freedoms and therefore trigger the requirement to carry out a Data Protection Impact Assessment, as well as potential additional regulatory obligations related to the deployment of high-risk AI systems in certain jurisdictions. Please consult with the E&C team or the DPO for more information on this.
   2. For further guidance on high-risk Processing activities please refer to Appendix 1. For guidance on carrying out Data Protection Impact Assessments, please refer to Appendix 2.

## SECURITY OF PERSONAL DATA

- 
  1. The Personal Data Protection Regulations require the ADNOC Group to implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risks linked to the Processing. These measures are meant, among other things, to ensure the ongoing confidentiality, integrity and availability of Personal Data. In this respect:

1. “Confidentiality” means that only people who are authorized to view each specific piece of Personal Data can access it.
2. “Integrity” means that Personal Data should be accurate and suitable for the purpose(s) for which it is Processed.
3. “Availability” means that authorized users should be able to access the Personal Data only if they need it for authorized purposes.
4. In outsourcing and sub-processing arrangements, legal obligations and responsibility for security measures for Personal Data Processing must be set out.
   1. The ADNOC Group has in place a range of technical and organizational measures including, but not limited to:
5. **Technical measures (information security): **measures to control physical and logical access to Personal Data, encrypted solutions to store Personal Data, password policies, recoverability measures like regularly reviewed backups, as well as annual check-ups of the measures in place. These are managed by the relevant Digital & Cybersecurity team.
6. **Organizational measures: **the existence of the Standard and this Procedure, the appointment of the DPOs, the implementation of escalation channels on Personal Data Processing matters, the Personal Data Registers, the Data Protection Impact Assessments and the assignment of roles and responsibilities across the organization.
   1. The development, deployment and use of AI systems in the context of Processing Personal Data may exacerbate certain security risks so additional security measures may need to be put in place in consultation with the relevant Digital & Cybersecurity team.

## ACCURACY, PURPOSE LIMITATION AND RETENTION OF PERSONAL DATA

- 
  1. The ADNOC Group must make every reasonable effort to ensure that Personal Data that is Processed is accurate, complete, kept up to date and used only for the purposes for which it was collected.
  2. In the context of the ADNOC Group’s development, deployment and use of AI systems (including any automated decision making and profiling), such AI systems must be sufficiently statistically accurate to ensure that any Personal Data generated by it is Processed lawfully, transparently and fairly.
  3. When Personal Data is no longer needed for the specified purposes it was collected or the retention period for such Personal Data (per applicable retention policies) has expired, it should be deleted or removed and disposed of securely in a way that protects the rights and privacy of Data Subjects and ensures the permanent erasure of Personal Data (e.g. shredding, disposal as confidential waste, or secure electronic deletion).
  4. There are, however, certain circumstances where Personal Data can or must be retained – for example, if required to exercise or defend against ongoing or future legal claims. In circumstances where the ADNOC Group is required to retain Personal Data, specific procedures may also need to be followed including restricting access to the Personal Data.
  5. The ADNOC Group should not use Personal Data for new, different or incompatible purposes from that for which it was first obtained, unless it has informed the Data Subject of the new purposes and they have consented where necessary.
  6. It is the responsibility of each business unit or area to ensure the Personal Data it owns is managed appropriately, retained only for the time defined as needed for the achievement of its intended purpose and accessible only by those persons who are permitted to do so.

## DATA PROTECTION CLAUSES IN CONTRACTS

- 
  1. Clauses that specify the rights and obligations of both parties regarding the Processing of Personal Data must be provisioned in contracts between the ADNOC Group and third parties (whether Data Controllers

or Data Processors) to ensure compliance with the applicable Personal Data Protection Regulations and to protect the interests and rights of the Data Subjects.

- 
  1. Personal Data Processing clauses may vary depending on the location of Personal Data and the nature and context of the Processing (i.e. whether the ADNOC Group is engaging a Data Controller or a Data Processor).
  2. When engaging Data Processors, these Personal Data Processing clauses would usually include the following elements:

1. The subject matter, nature, purpose, and duration of the Processing.
2. The type and categories of Personal Data and Data Subjects involved.
3. The obligations and instructions of the Data Controller to the Data Processor regarding the Processing.
4. The obligation of the Data Processor to Process the Personal Data only on behalf of and in accordance with the instructions of the Data Controller, and to implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure the security and confidentiality of the Personal Data.
   1. Consult the relevant E&C team or the DPO to advise on appropriate Personal Data Processing clauses.

## RIGHTS OF DATA SUBJECTS

- 
  1. The relevant E&C team or the DPO must be engaged when handling and responding to any requests or complaints from Data Subjects regarding their rights, within the timeframes and procedures specified by the relevant Personal Data Protection Regulations.
  2. Subject to the applicable Personal Data Protection Regulations, when Data Subjects exercise the rights set out in section 8 of the Standard, the ADNOC Group needs to respond to the request as soon as possible and, in any case, within 30 calendar days. Where necessary, the deadline may be extended to 60 calendar days, in which case the ADNOC Group shall inform the Data Subject within the initial 30 days period of the extension and the reasons thereof.
  3. In order to respond to these requests in a compliant manner, any ADNOC Group Personnel who receives such a request must forward it to the relevant E&C team or the DPO immediately and without delay.
  4. For further guidance in respect of the rights of Data Subjects and how to respond to them, please refer to Appendix 3.

## INDIVIDUAL OBLIGATIONS

- 
  1. All ADNOC Group Personnel are responsible for helping the ADNOC Group keep their Personal Data up to date by informing their respective Human Capital team if their information changes, such as a new address or bank account details.
  2. In the performance of their duties, ADNOC Group Personnel may have access to Personal Data of other Data Subjects including other ADNOC Group Personnel, customers, suppliers and visitors to the ADNOC

Group’s premises or websites. In such circumstances, the ADNOC Group expects each ADNOC Group Personnel to help meet ADNOC Group’s Personal Data Processing obligations to those individuals.

- 
  1. If ADNOC Group Personnel have access to Personal Data, they must:

1. access any Personal Data for authorised purposes only;
2. allow other ADNOC Group Personnel to access it only if needed as part of their duty or with proper authorisations in place;
3. restrict any external Data Subjects or entities from accessing Personal Data without specific authority from the E&C team or DPO;
4. keep Personal Data secure by following guidelines on access, classification, handling, password protection, and secure storage/destruction;
5. not remove Personal Data or devices containing Personal Data from ADNOC Group premises without proper security measures like encryption or password protection; and
6. not store Personal Data on unauthorised media or data repositories, such as local drives, personal devices, removable storage or similar.

## DATA BREACH NOTIFICATION

- 
  1. Any ADNOC Group Personnel who become aware of or suspects a Personal Data Breach must immediately report this via the Digital Help Desk on 80048 or the Digital Self Service Portal and to the E&C team or the DPO, and provide all relevant information and assistance. Notification to the relevant E&C team and the DPO should be done in the most appropriate and efficient manner for the situation whether that be in person, over the phone or by email. It is imperative to document this information in ADNOC Group’s Suspected Personal Data Breach Reporting Form at Appendix 4 of this Procedure.
  2. All Data Breaches reported to the Digital Help Desk or Digital Self Service Portal will be directed to the relevant E&C team and the DPO for initial assessment. After the severity and impact of the Personal Data Breach is assessed, the E&C team and the DPO will determine whether it poses a risk to the Data Subjects or the ADNOC Group in accordance with the Data Breach Response Plan at Appendix 5 of this Procedure.
  3. If the Data Breach is likely to result in a high risk to the rights of Data Subjects, the affected Data Subjects should be notified without undue delay (including on the nature and consequences of the Data Breach, as well as the measures taken or proposed to address it). Additionally, if the Data Breach is likely to result in a risk to the rights of Data Subjects, the relevant Supervisory Authority may need to be notified within the time frame (usually 72 hours) specified by the applicable Personal Data Protection Regulations or otherwise the justification for the delay should be provided.
  4. For further guidance in respect of Personal Data Breaches please refer to Appendix 4.

## SHARING, DISCLOSING AND TRANSFERRING OF PERSONAL DATA

- 
  1. The ADNOC Group may instruct a third party, a Data Processor, to Process Personal Data on behalf of the ADNOC Group. In this case, the ADNOC Group and the Data Processor have to enter into a written

agreement (also called “data processing agreement”), which includes mandatory terms and safeguards required under applicable Personal Data Protection Regulations. Due diligence should be carried out on the Data Processor before signing the agreement, and periodically after that to ensure that both the ADNOC Group and the Data Processor meet their respective, technological and organisational security measures, and legal and regulatory obligations. Consult with the DPO and relevant Digital & Cybersecurity team for more details.

- 
  1. The ADNOC Group must ensure that Personal Data is not disclosed to unauthorized third parties. All ADNOC Group Personnel should exercise caution when asked to disclose any Personal Data to a third party other than in line with requirements set out in section 15.1 above. In some circumstances, disclosure of Personal Data without needing to obtain the prior consent of the Data Subject may be permitted where this is necessary to safeguard national security, prevent or detect a crime in the substantial public interest, in the administration of justice, comply with applicable law or necessary to protect the vital interests of the Data Subject (e.g. life and death situations). In such circumstances the relevant E&C team and DPO must be consulted.
  2. Specific legal requirements may apply to the transfer of Personal Data out of the country or territory where it originates from. The “transfer” of data includes sending data to another country or allowing that data to be accessed remotely in another country, regardless of whether the ADNOC Group transfers Personal Data outside the jurisdiction itself or a Data Processor does so when acting on the ADNOC Group’s behalf. In general, Personal Data must not be transferred to countries or organizations that do not provide an adequate level of protection, unless appropriate safeguards are in place, such as standard contractual clauses, binding corporate rules, or approved certifications. There are also other instances when transfers may be permitted such as if it is important for reasons of public interest, required by law enforcement agencies, legal claims, or necessary in order to protect the vital interest of the Data Subject. The relevant E&C team or the DPO should be consulted when sharing, disclosure or transfer of Personal Data to another country is considered. For any other third-party information sharing the respective Digital & Cybersecurity team should be consulted to assess the request and initiate the information sharing procedure.

## MARKETING

- 
  1. Specific rules and privacy laws may apply if Personal Data is used to market electronically to individual customers or prospective customers (via emails, texts, calls, SMS, and social media), unless an exemption applies under law. An opt-out option should be offered when collecting details and in every marketing communication.
  2. Any objection to direct marketing must be promptly honoured. If an individual opts out, their details should be suppressed immediately.
  3. The ADNOC Group cannot sell or disclose Data Subject’s Personal Data to third parties who intend to use this Personal Data to telemarket products and services to these Data Subjects.
  4. Please follow any specific marketing guidelines issued by the ADNOC Group in this regard.

## APPENDIX 1: GUIDANCE ON SENSITIVE PERSONAL DATA AND HIGH-RISK PROCESSING ACTIVITIES

### Introduction

- 
  1. This guidance is intended to help identify what constitutes: (i) Sensitive Personal Data; and/or (ii) ‘high risk’ Personal Data Processing activities.
  2. The Processing of Sensitive Personal Data and ‘high risk’ Processing activities are likely to present a greater risk to the rights and freedoms of Data Subject and therefore require a Data Protection Impact Assessment. For more information on how to complete a Data Protection Impact Assessment, please refer to Appendix 2.

### Sensitive Personal Data

- 
  1. Most common categories of Sensitive Personal Data include:
     1. family, racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, trade union related view or activities, religious or philosophical beliefs of a Data Subjects;
     2. genetic data, biometric data for the purpose of uniquely identifying a natural person;
     3. health data or data concerning a natural person’s sex life or sexual orientation;
     4. criminal convictions and offences or related security measures; and
     5. any other data identified as Sensitive Personal Data or subject to specific Processing restrictions under the applicable Personal Data Protection Regulations.
  2. Most of the categories of Sensitive Personal Data above are self-explanatory, but ‘biometric data’ is often specifically defined in Personal Data Protection Regulations and key principles are summarised below.
  3. Personal Data Protection Regulations generally deem that the large-scale Processing of Sensitive Personal Data will be ‘high risk Processing’ requiring the prior implementation of additional legal measures and controls, which should be informed by completing a Data Protection Impact Assessment.
  4. Please read our guidance on Data Protection Impact Assessments, available at Appendix 2 for more information.

### Biometric data

- 
  1. Biometric data is Personal Data resulting from Processing, using a specific technique, relating to the physical, physiological or behavioural characteristics of a Data Subject, which allows or confirms the unique identification of the Data Subject, such as facial images.
  2. Examples of physical or physiological biometrical identification techniques include racial recognition, fingerprint verification, iris scanning, retinal analysis, voice recognition or ear shape recognition.
  3. Examples of behavioural biometric identification techniques include keystroke analysis, handwritten signature analysis, gait analysis or gaze analysis (eye tracking).
  4. All biometric data is Personal Data, as it allows or confirms the identification of an individual. Biometric data is also Sensitive Personal Data whenever it is Processed to confirm the unique identification of the Data Subject. This means that biometric data will always be Sensitive Personal Data.

### High-risk Processing activities

- 
  1. Personal Data Protection Regulations generally state that the systematic use of certain types of technologies and Processing activities and operations would likely be high risk Processing, requiring the prior implementation of additional legal measures and controls, including undertaking a Data Protection Impact Assessment.

## APPENDIX 2: GUIDANCE ON DATA PROTECTION IMPACT ASSESSMENTS

### Introduction

- 
  1. A Data Protection Impact Assessment is a process that is intended to help ADNOC Group identify and minimise its Personal Data Processing risks where it is conducting an activity and/or undertaking a project which involves the Processing of Personal Data that is likely to result in a high risk to individuals (please refer to Appendix 1 for further guidance on high-risk Processing activities).
  2. A Data Protection Impact Assessment must:
     1. describe the Processing and the purposes of the Processing of the Personal Data;
     2. assess the necessity and proportionality of the Processing of the Personal Data;
     3. identify and consider the lawful basis for the Processing of the Personal Data;
     4. identify and assess the risks to Data Subjects; and
     5. identify any measures to help mitigate such risks and protect the Personal Data.
  3. The Data Protection Impact Assessment does not have to eradicate all risks, but it should document the risks and assess whether or not any remaining risks are justified and mitigated. The Data Protection Impact Assessment process should be conducted in consultation with the relevant E&C team and the DPO.
  4. Data Protection risks identified during the Data Protection Impact Assessment process must be assessed and treated in line with the applicable Group Digital & Cybersecurity risk management standards, manuals, or procedures.
  5. Data Protection Impact Assessments should consider compliance risks, but also broader risks to the rights and freedoms of Data Subjects, including the potential for any significant social or economic disadvantage. The focus is on the potential for harm – to Data Subjects or to society at large, whether it is physical, material or non-material.

### What does this mean for ADNOC Group?

- 
  1. These high-risk activities and/or projects should be reported to the E&C team or a DPO to determine if a Data Protection Impact Assessment should be undertaken. A template of the Data Protection Impact Assessment is set out below.
  2. Where there are complex issues/higher risk elements that arise from the Data Protection Impact Assessment, these will be escalated to the relevant E&C team and the DPO for review/consideration and if thought fit, approval.
  3. Data Protection Impact Assessments are an essential part of ADNOC Group’s legal obligations under the Personal Data Protection Regulations. Under these laws, a failure to carry out a Data Protection Impact Assessment when required may damage ADNOC Group’s reputation, erode trust in the organisation, and can result in legal action or financial penalties being incurred. Accordingly, all Data Protection Impact Assessments, including outcomes and approvals, should be recorded and maintained.
  4. Any doubt as to whether or not a Data Protection Impact Assessment is needed will be resolved by the relevant E&C team and the DPO.

### When does ADNOC Group need to undertake a Data Protection Impact Assessment?

- 
  1. The relevant business team in consultation with the E&C team or the DPO is required to undertake a Data Protection Impact Assessment before beginning any type of Processing (any activity or project) that is ‘likely to result in a high risk’. To assess the level of risk, you must consider both the likelihood and the severity of any impact on Data Subjects. High risk could result from either a high probability of some harm, or a lower possibility of serious harm.
  2. The Processing of large amounts of Sensitive Personal Data and ‘high risk’ Processing activities are likely to present a greater risk to the rights and freedoms of Data Subjects and therefore require a Data Protection Impact Assessment to be undertaken.
  3. For more details and examples of Processing activities that are likely to require undertaking a Data Protection Impact Assessment, please see Appendix 1.
  4. A Data Protection Impact Assessment will not be required where the nature, scope, context and purposes of the envisaged activity are very similar to Processing activities for which a Data Protection Impact Assessment has already been carried out, provided that the existing Data Protection Impact Assessment remains current and accurate (and, in these circumstances, the results of the existing Data Protection Impact Assessment can be used). You should seek guidance from the relevant E&C team and the DPO before relying on this exemption.
  5. If ADNOC Group decides not to carry out a Data Protection Impact Assessment, it should document its risk assessment and the justification for not conducting a Data Protection Impact Assessment.

### How should ADNOC Group conduct a Data Protection Impact Assessment?

- 
  1. Step 1 – Identify a need for a Data Protection Impact Assessment
     1. Consider the Processing activity and summarise why a Data Protection Impact Assessment is required, based on this guidance.
  2. Step 2 – Describe the Processing
     1. Describe the nature of the Processing, including for example:
         1. how ADNOC Group collects the Personal Data;
         2. how ADNOC Group stores the Personal Data;
         3. how ADNOC Group uses the Personal Data;
         4. who has access to the Personal Data;
         5. who ADNOC Group shares the Personal Data with;
         6. whether ADNOC Group uses any Data Processors;
         7. retention periods;
         8. security measures;
         9. whether ADNOC Group is using any new technologies;
        10. whether ADNOC Group is using any novel types of Processing; and
        11. which screening criteria ADNOC flagged as likely high risk.
     2. Describe the scope of the Processing, including for example:
        1. the nature of the Personal Data;
        2. the volume and variety of the Personal Data;
        3. the sensitivity of the Personal Data;
        4. the extent and frequency of the Processing;
        5. the duration of the Processing;
        6. the number of Data Subjects involved; and
        7. the geographical area covered.
     3. Describe the context of the Processing, i.e. the wider picture, including internal and external factors which might affect expectations or impact, including for example:
        1. the source of the Personal Data;
        2. the nature of ADNOC Group’s relationship with the individuals;
        3. how far individuals have control over their Personal Data;
        4. how far individuals are likely to expect the Processing;
        5. any previous experience of this type of Processing;
        6. any relevant advances in technology or security; and
        7. any current issues of public concern.
     4. Describe the purposes of the Processing, including for example:
        1. ADNOC Group’s legitimate interests, where relevant;
        2. the intended outcome for individuals; and
        3. the expected benefits for ADNOC Group.
  3. Step 3 – Identify and assess lawful basis
     1. Identify, consider and describe the lawful basis for the Processing, including but not limited to:
        1. where legitimate interests are the basis for the Processing, an analysis and explanation of why ADNOC Group believes the interests or rights of a Data Subject do not override its interests;
        2. where consent is the basis for the Processing, confirmation that such consent is validly obtained, consideration of the impact of withdrawal of such consent and how ADNOC Group will ensure compliance with the exercise of a Data Subject’s right to withdraw consent; and
        3. where compliance with a legal obligation is the basis for Processing, ADNOC Group will also

need to identify the specific legal obligation or right in question, either by reference to the

specific legal provision or else by pointing to an appropriate source of advice or guidance that sets it out clearly.

- 
  1. Step 4 – Consult individuals
     1. Seek and document the views of the following individuals:
        1. affected individuals or their representatives (unless it compromises commercial confidentiality, undermines security or is disproportionate or impracticable);
        2. internal stakeholders;
        3. input from Data Processors to help understand and document their Processing activities and identify any associated risks;
        4. the relevant E&C team and the DPO; and
        5. any external advisors.
  2. Step 5 – Assess necessity and proportionality
     1. Consider whether the intended Processing helps ADNOC Group achieve its purposes.
     2. Consider whether there is another reasonable way to achieve the same result.
  3. Step 6 – Identify and assess risks
     1. Identify the risks by considering the potential impact on individuals and any harm or damage the Processing may cause, in particular, whether the Processing could contribute to:
         1. inability to exercise rights (including but not limited to privacy rights);
         2. inability to access services or opportunities;
         3. loss of control over the use of Personal Data;
         4. discrimination;
         5. identity theft or fraud;
         6. financial loss;
         7. reputational damage;
         8. physical harm;
         9. loss of confidentiality;
        10. re-identification of pseudonymised data; or
        11. any other significant economic or social disadvantage.
     2. Make an objective assessment of the risk by considering both the likelihood and severity of the possible harm, including taking into account the following factors:
        1. harm does not have to be inevitable to qualify as a high risk, but must be more than remote;
        2. any significant possibility of very serious harm may still be enough to qualify as high risk; or
        3. a high probably of widespread but more minor harm may still count as high risk.
  4. Step 7 – Identifying mitigating measures to reduce risk
     1. Consider and document options for reducing each risk identified, including whether the measure would reduce or eliminate the risk (considering cost and benefit), for example:
         1. deciding not to collect certain types of Personal Data;
         2. reducing the scope of the Processing;
         3. reducing retention periods;
         4. taking additional technological security measures;
         5. training staff to ensure risks are anticipated and managed;
         6. anonymising or pseudonymising Personal Data where possible;
         7. writing internal guidance or processes to avoid risks;
         8. using a different technology;
         9. agreeing contractual protections with third parties;
        10. making changes to privacy notices;
        11. offering individuals the chance to opt out where appropriate;
        12. implementing new systems to help individuals to exercise their rights; or
        13. implementing privacy by design and by default.
  5. Step 8 – Approve the Data Protection Impact Assessment and record outcomes
     1. At the end of the Data Protection Impact Assessment process, record:
        1. what additional measures ADNOC Group plans to take;
        2. whether each risk has been eliminated, reduced, or accepted;
        3. the overall level of ‘residual risk’ after taking additional measures; and
        4. consult the relevant E&C team and the DPO if the residual risk constitutes any high risk that ADNOC Group intends to accept, as that could require consulting the relevant Supervisory Authority before going ahead with the Processing.
  6. Step 9 – Review the Data Protection Impact Assessment
     1. Undertake periodic reviews of past Data Protection Impact Assessments and carry out the assessment again, if necessary (particularly where there is a change in the risk related to the Processing activity).

**Data Protection Impact Assessment Template Part A: Introduction**

This Data Protection Impact Assessment must be completed and sent to the relevant E&C team and the DPO for review/consideration and if thought fit, approval, prior to starting any high risk Processing activity as determined in accordance with the guidance in Appendix 1 above or, if the activity has already started, prior to continuing with the activity. If you become aware of any significant change to the activity or significant increase in the risk posed to individuals by the activity after the date on which the activity is first approved by the relevant E&C team and the DPO, then please raise this with the E&C team and the DPO and seek further approval.

This Data Protection Impact Assessment should clearly describe, in accordance with the ADNOC Group’s guidance on Data Protection Impact Assessments:

1. the proposed Processing activity;
2. the purpose of the activity and the benefits it is likely to deliver to ADNOC Group;
3. the lawful basis for the proposed Processing activity;
4. any likely adverse impact of the activities;
5. the steps that can be taken to mitigate the adverse impact;
6. alternatives to the activity; and
7. the outcomes that arise from the activity and how these will be satisfied.

| **Step 4: Consult individuals**  **Consider how to consult with relevant stakeholders:**  - _Describe when and how ADNOC Group will seek individuals’ views, or justify why it is not appropriate to do so._ - _Describe which internal stakeholders within ADNOC Group need to be involved._ - _Consider whether any third-party Data Processors should assist._ - _Consult information security experts or instruct external legal advisers._  [Complete.]                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| **Step 5: Assess necessity and proportionality**  **Describe compliance and proportionality measures, in particular:**  - _In consultation with the relevant E&C team and the DPO, set out ADNOC Group’s lawful basis for Processing (one of: consent, contract with the individual, compliance with a legal obligation or legitimate interests (if legitimate interests is relied on, describe what those legitimate interests are))._ - _Does the Processing actually achieve ADNOC Group’s purpose?_ - _Is there another way to achieve the same outcome?_ - _How will ADNOC Group prevent function creep?_ - _How will ADNOC Group ensure data quality and data minimisation?_ - _What information will ADNOC Group give individuals about the Processing?_ - _How will ADNOC Group help to support their rights?_ - _What measures does ADNOC Group take to ensure Data Processors comply?_ - _How does ADNOC Group safeguard any international transfers?_  [Complete.] |

**Step 6: Identify and assess risks**

_For example, this will include any invasion of the individual’s privacy, any adverse impact on the ability of individuals to exercise their rights under data protection law, the extent to which the Processing is likely to fall outside of the individual’s reasonable expectations about how ADNOC Group will Process Personal Data about them, any potential prejudice or damage (whether physical, mental, reputational or financial) that the individual may suffer as a result of the Processing, and any risk that would be posed to the individuals if the Personal Data were to be accessed, disclosed, modified, damaged or deleted accidentally, or in an unauthorized or unlawful manner._

## APPENDIX 3: GUIDANCE ON DATA SUBJECT RIGHTS AND REQUESTS

### Introduction

- 
  1. Data Subjects have certain rights under the applicable Personal Data Protection Regulations in respect of their Personal Data. This guidance provides a framework for identifying and responding to Data Subject rights.

### What rights do these include

- 
  1. The key rights which Data Subjects have in respect of their Personal Data under the applicable Personal Data Protection Regulations are set out in section 8 of the Standard.

### How to identify a request

- 
  1. Requests can be made to any part of ADNOC Group and in any form, including verbally, via email, social media or other methods. A request is valid if it is clear that the Data Subject is asking for their own Personal Data. A Data Subject does not need to use a specific form of words, refer to legislation or direct the request to a specific contact.
  2. A Data Subject may ask a third party (e.g. a relative, friend or lawyer) to make a request on their behalf. You may also receive a request made on behalf of a Data Subject through an online portal. Before responding, we need to be satisfied prior to responding to the request and disclosing a Data Subject’s Personal Data that the third party making the request is entitled to act on behalf of the Data Subject. It is the third party’s responsibility to provide evidence of their authority.
  3. The relevant E&C team and the DPO are responsible for handling requests and all ADNOC Group Personnel are responsible for following the guidelines and instructions of the E&C team or a DPO.

### General requirements when responding to requests

- 
  1. When responding to requests, we should generally communicate in writing (which can include email) but we can reply verbally if specifically requested by the Data Subject. In any case, we must be satisfied with the identity of the Data Subject.
  2. If the request is manifestly unfounded or excessive, for example, because of its repetitive character, we may charge a reasonable fee, taking into account the administrative costs of providing the Personal Data, or refuse to act on the request.
  3. If, where permitted under Personal Data Protection Regulations, we are not going to respond to the request, we must inform the Data Subject of the reason(s) for not taking action and of the possibility of lodging a complaint with your applicable Supervisory Authority.
  4. This guidance only applies to Data Subjects whose Personal Data we Process (although if we receive an access request from someone whose Personal Data we do not Process, we should confirm to them that we do not Process their Personal Data).

### Record keeping

- 
  1. It is important that we keep accurate records of requests that we receive and how we handle them.
  2. When determining whether we hold Personal Data, we should document what searches we have carried out.

### Where to get further information and advice

- 
  1. Any questions about Data Subject rights or the procedures relevant to your function should be raised with your E&C team or the DPO.

### Responding to requests to access Personal Data

- 
  1. Data Subjects have the right to request access to their Personal Data Processed by us. These requests are called “**Subject Access Requests**”.
  2. When a Data Subject makes a Subject Access Request, we must take the following steps:
     1. log the date on which the request was received (to ensure that the relevant timeframe for responding to the request is met);
     2. confirm the identity of the Data Subject. For example, we may request additional information from the Data Subject to confirm their identity;
     3. search databases, systems, applications and other places where the Personal Data which is the subject of the request may be held; and
     4. confirm to the Data Subject whether or not Personal Data of the Data Subject making the Subject Access Request is being Processed.
  3. If Personal Data of the Data Subject is being Processed, we are obliged to provide the Data Subject with certain information about their Personal Data.
  4. We must also, where required by the Personal Data Protection Regulations, provide the Data Subject with a copy of the Personal Data Processed by us in a commonly used electronic form (unless the Data Subject either did not make the request by electronic means or has specifically requested not to be provided with the copy in electronic form) without charge and within one month of receipt of the request. If the request is complex, or there are several requests, we may extend the period for responding by a further two months. If we extend the period for responding, we must inform the Data Subject within one month of receipt of the request and explain the reason(s) for the delay.
  5. Before providing the Personal Data to the Data Subject making the Subject Access Request, we must review the Personal Data requested to see if it contains the Personal Data of other Data Subjects. If it does, we may redact the Personal Data of those other Data Subjects before providing the Data Subject with their Personal Data, unless those other Data Subjects have consented to the disclosure of their Personal Data or it is reasonable to disclose without their consent (taking into

account, for example, the type of Personal Data and whether the other person has expressly refused consent).

### Responding to requests to rectify Personal Data

- 
  1. Data Subjects have the right to have their inaccurate Personal Data rectified. Rectification can include having incomplete Personal Data completed, for example, by a Data Subject providing a supplementary statement regarding the Personal Data. Where such a request is made, we must, where required by the Personal Data Protection Regulations, rectify the Personal Data without undue delay.
  2. We must also communicate the rectification of the Personal Data to each recipient to whom the Personal Data have been disclosed (for example, our third-party service providers who Process the Personal Data on our behalf), unless this is impossible or involves disproportionate effort. We must also inform the Data Subject about those recipients if the Data Subject requests it.

### Responding to requests for the erasure of Personal Data

- 
  1. Data Subjects have the right, in certain circumstances, to request that we erase their Personal Data. Where such a request is made, we must, where required by Personal Data Protection Regulations, erase the Personal Data without undue delay if:
     1. the Personal Data is no longer necessary in relation to the purposes for which it was collected or otherwise Processed;
     2. the Data Subject withdraws their consent to the Processing of their Personal Data and consent was the basis on which the Personal Data was Processed and there is no other legal basis for the Processing;
     3. the Data Subject objects to the Processing of their Personal Data or there are no legitimate reasons for us to continue Processing;
     4. the Personal Data has been unlawfully Processed;
     5. the Personal Data has to be erased for compliance with a legal obligation to which we are subject;
     6. the Data Subject objects to the Processing of their Personal Data for direct marketing purposes; or
     7. the Personal Data has been collected in relation to the offer of e-commerce or other online services.
  2. When a Data Subject makes a request for erasure in the circumstances set out above, we must, where required by the Personal Data Protection Regulations, take the following steps:
     1. log the date on which the request was received (to ensure that the relevant timeframe for responding to the request is met);
     2. confirm the identity of the Data Subject who is the subject of the request. We may request additional information from the Data Subject to do this;
     3. search databases, systems, applications and other places where the Personal Data which is the subject of the request may be held and erase that data within one month of receipt of the request. If the request is complex, or there are several requests, we may extend the period for responding by a further two months. If we extend the period for responding we must inform the Data Subject within one month of receipt of the request and explain the reason(s) for the delay;
     4. where we have made the Personal Data public, we must, taking reasonable steps, including technical measures, inform those who are Processing the Personal Data that the Data Subject has requested the erasure by them of any links to, or copies or replications of, that Personal Data; and
     5. communicate the erasure of the Personal Data to each recipient to whom the Personal Data has been disclosed unless this is impossible or involves disproportionate effort. We must also inform the Data Subject about those recipients if the Data Subject requests it.

### Responding to requests to restrict the Processing of Personal Data

- 
  1. Data Subjects have the right, where required by the applicable Personal Data Protection Regulations, to restrict the Processing of their Personal Data if:
     1. the Data Subject contests the accuracy of the Personal Data, for a period to allow us to verify the accuracy of the Personal Data;
     2. the Processing is unlawful, and the Data Subject opposes the erasure of the Personal Data and requests the restriction of its use instead;
     3. we no longer need the Personal Data for the purposes we collected it, but it is required by the Data Subject for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims; and
     4. the Data Subject has objected to the Processing, pending verification of whether we have legitimate grounds to override the Data Subject's objection.
  2. Where Processing has been restricted, we must only Process the Personal Data (excluding storing it):
     1. with the Data Subject's consent;
     2. for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims;
     3. for the protection of the rights of another person; or
     4. for reasons of important public interest.
  3. Before lifting the restriction, we must inform the Data Subject of the lifting of the restriction.
  4. We must communicate the restriction of Processing of the Personal Data to each recipient to whom the Personal Data has been disclosed, unless this is impossible or involves disproportionate effort. We must also inform the Data Subject about those recipients if the Data Subject requests it.

### Responding to requests for the portability of Personal Data

- 
  1. Data Subjects have the right, in certain circumstances, to receive their Personal Data that they have provided to us in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format that they can then transmit to another company. Where such a request is made, we must, where required by the Personal Data Protection Regulations, provide the Personal Data without undue delay if:
     1. the legal basis for the Processing of the Personal Data is consent or pursuant to a contract; and
     2. our Processing of that data is automated.
  2. When a Data Subject makes a request for portability in the circumstances set out above, we must take the following steps:
     1. log the date on which the request was received (to ensure that the relevant timeframe for responding to the request is met);
     2. confirm the identity of the Data Subject. We may request additional information from the Data Subject to confirm their identity; and
     3. search databases, systems, applications and other places where the Personal Data which is the subject of the request may be held and provide the Data Subject with that data (or, at the Data Subject's request, transmit the Personal Data directly to another company, where technically feasible) within one month of receipt of the request. If the request is complex, or there are several requests, we may extend the period for responding by a further two months. If we extend the period for responding, we must inform the Data Subject within one month of receipt of the request and explain the reason(s) for the delay.

### Responding to objections to the Processing of Personal Data

- 
  1. Data Subjects have the right to object to and stop the Processing of their Personal Data where that Processing is:
     1. for direct marketing purposes (including profiling). If a Data Subject makes such a request, we must stop Processing the Personal Data for those purposes;
     2. for statistical purposes, unless the Processing is necessary for the performance of a task carried out for reasons of public interest; or
     3. in violation of the principles of Personal Data Protection Regulations.

### Responding to requests not to be subject to automated decision-making

- 
  1. Data Subjects have the right, in certain circumstances, not to be subject to a decision based solely on the automated Processing of their Personal Data, if that decision produces legal effects concerning them or similarly significantly affects them. Where such a request is made, we must, where required by applicable law, no longer make such a decision unless it:
     1. is necessary for entering into, or the performance of, a contract between us and the Data Subject;
     2. is authorised by applicable law; or
     3. is based on the Data Subject's explicit consent.
  2. If we decide not to honour such a request in line with the above we will implement suitable measures to safeguard the Data Subject's rights, freedoms and legitimate interests, including the right to obtain human intervention, to express their point of view and to contest the decision.
  3. In relation to the ADNOC Group’s development, deployment and use of AI systems, automated decision-making can manifest either by:
     1. solely automated decision-making, where the AI system makes the decision automatically, or
     2. partly automated decision-making (decision support), where the AI system only supports a human decision-maker in their deliberation.
  4. Only AI systems which make solely automated decisions will trigger ADNOC’s legal requirements to honour Data Subject requests in this regard, or the necessity to implement suitable measures / exclusions (set out above) to reject these requests.
  5. In addition, engaged and critical human oversight of the relevant AI system’s output will help to justify that the AI system is partly automated decision-making (decision support) and therefore outside of the scope of the Data Subject request. However, the degree and quality of human review and intervention in the decision-making process are key in determining whether an AI system is being used for automated decision-making or as decision support. If they are not sufficient then seemingly partial automated decision-making may, in fact, be solely automated decision-making.
  6. Relevant factors the ADNOC Group should consider in this regard, include:
     1. human reviewers must be involved in checking the system’s recommendation and should not just apply the automated recommendation to an individual in a routine fashion;
     2. reviewer’s involvement must be active and not just a token gesture and they should have the authority and competence to go against the recommendation; and
     3. reviewers must weigh-up and interpret the recommendation, consider all available input data, and also take into account additional factors.

## APPENDIX 4: GUIDANCE ON PERSONAL DATA BREACHES

### About this Guidance

- 
  1. Under the applicable Personal Data Protection Regulations, ADNOC Group is typically a Data Controller in relation to the Personal Data of our clients, prospective clients, suppliers and our staff. That means that, amongst other things, we are responsible under the law for ensuring that such Personal Data is kept securely and protected from accidental loss or unauthorised access. That is true whether it is ADNOC Group Processing Personal Data, or Processing is by third parties that we appoint to Process Personal Data on our behalf, who act as Data Processors.
  2. The aim of this guidance is to help ADNOC Group Personnel understand and identify instances of Personal Data Breaches to enable swift and appropriate remedial action and reporting to be taken in the event that a Personal Data Breach may occur.

### What are Personal Data Breaches?

- 
  1. Personal Data Protection Regulations generally define a Personal Data Breach as a breach of security leading to the accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorised disclosure of, or access to, Personal Data transmitted, stored or otherwise Processed. Legal reporting obligations apply where there is a breach of Personal Data which poses a level of risk to affected individuals.
  2. It is the role of the relevant E&C team or the DPO to ascertain whether the potential or suspected Personal Data Breach is in fact a Personal Data Breach which should be reported to the relevant Supervisory Authorities, however it is still very important for our staff to be able to define and identify instances of Personal Data Breaches in order to report them to the relevant E&C team or the DPO.

### Further clarifications

- 
  1. Given the fairly generic definition under the Personal Data Protection Regulations (which is likely to lead to a wide range of differing interpretations as to a data breach), further guidance has been published, by international data authorities, for the following concepts which each feature in the definition:
     1. **Destruction: **this is where the data no longer exists, or no longer exists in a form that is of any use to the Data Controller;
     2. **Damage: **this is where Personal Data has been altered, corrupted, or is no longer complete;
     3. **Loss**: this is when the Personal Data may still exist, but the Data Controller has lost control or access to it, or no longer has it in its possession;
     4. **Unauthorised or unlawful Processing**: this is disclosure of Personal Data to (or access by) recipients who are not authorised to receive (or access) the data, or any other form of Processing which violates the Personal Data Protection Regulations (for example when legal basis for Processing does not exist or when the Data Subject has expressed its objection to Processing).

### Categorisations

- 
  1. Personal Data Breaches can be categorised according to the following three well-known information security principles:
     1. **Availability breach **– where there is an accidental or unauthorised permanent or temporary loss of access to, or destruction of, Personal Data. This obviously does not include the temporary unavailability events related to scheduled maintenance;
     2. **Confidentiality breach **– where there is an unauthorised or accidental disclosure of, or access to, Personal Data; and
     3. **Integrity breach **– where there is an unauthorised or accidental alteration of Personal Data.
  2. It should also be noted that, depending on the circumstances, a Personal Data Breach can concern confidentiality, integrity and availability of Personal Data at the same time, as well as any combination of these.

### Examples of Personal Data Breaches

- 
  1. Below are examples of Personal Data Breaches that, under the Personal Data Protection Regulations, may require us to report such incidents to the relevant Supervisory Authorities. Please note that this is not an exhaustive list.

### Internal reporting of Personal Data Breaches

- 
  1. It is vital that all potential or suspected Personal Data Breaches are immediately reported to the relevant E&C team or the DPO as soon as they are identified.
  2. Any individual who has access to, uses or manages ADNOC Group’s information is responsible for reporting a Personal Data Breach and information security incidents immediately to the relevant E&C team or the DPO. If the Personal Data Breach occurs or is discovered outside normal working hours, it must be reported as soon as is practicable
  3. It is the role of relevant E&C team or the DPO to ascertain whether the potential or suspected Personal Data Breach is in fact a Personal Data Breach which should be reported to the relevant Supervisory Authorities.

### What information should be provided in your report to relevant E&C team or the DPO?

- 
  1. We recommend that the information set out in the form below should be provided in your report.
  2. Prompt reporting of any potential or suspected Personal Data Breaches to the relevant E&C team or the DPO is crucial to ensure compliance with our obligations under the Personal Data Protection Regulations, which contains a number of action points that must be put into immediate effect when the relevant E&C team or the DPO is alerted or notified of a potential or suspected Personal Data Breach. Depending on the nature of the incident, the relevant E&C team or the DPO is responsible for reporting the Personal Data Breach to the relevant Supervisory Authorities without undue delay and in any event within 72 hours of becoming aware of the Personal Data Breach.
  3. These detailed action points are comprised in the “Data Breach Response Plan” at Appendix 5 below.
  4. However, for ADNOC Group Personnel more generally, the most important obligation to be aware of is that any potential or suspected Personal Data Breach should be reported immediately to the relevant E&C team or the DPO. In implementing the “Data Breach Response Plan”, the relevant E&C team or the DPO will investigate the potential or suspected Personal Data Breach, liaising with individuals as necessary to assess whether it is a Personal Data Breach and the level of risk to the affected individuals, consider containment measures and determine whether: (i) a notification to the authorities; and/or (ii) a communication to the affected individuals is required.

### Form: Suspected Personal Data Breach Reporting Form

The following information should be provided in your report to the relevant E&C team or the DPO if you suspect or become aware of a Personal Data Breach:

## APPENDIX 5: DATA BREACH RESPONSE PLAN

### About this Guidance

- 
  1. This Data Breach Response Plan documents ADNOC Group’s approach when managing and responding to Personal Data Breaches to ensure that ADNOC Group is able to efficiently coordinate a response to any Personal Data Breach and take appropriate remedial action as and when required.
  2. This Data Breach Response Plan contains four separate parts based on the following four phases of activity which are typically involved when responding to a Personal Data Breach: (A) Detection;

(B) Analysis; (C) Recovery and (D) Response and which should be actioned by the representatives from the respective ADNOC Group company’s Legal, E&C, Digital & Cybersecurity and Communications teams (together, "**Data Breach Response Team**”).

- 
  1. In implementing this Data Breach Response Plan, the Data Breach Response Team will investigate the potential or suspected Personal Data Breach, liaising with relevant individuals as necessary to assess whether it is a Personal Data Breach and the level of risk to the affected individuals, consider containment measures and determine whether: (i) a notification to any authorities; and/or (ii) a communication to the affected individuals is required.

### Data Breach Response Plan under the Four Phases

- 
  1. Dealing with a Personal Data Breach is a complex, fast-moving process. Remedial steps are often interchangeable across the spectrum of the process, but it is helpful to categorise an incident into four categories or phases when managing the response:

| **Detection** | - Activation of core response team and incident response plan - Initial factual assessment and triage - Begin evidence preservation - Initial legal considerations including notification of regulators and individuals, as required                   |
| :------------ | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Analysis**  | - Conduct an impact analysis - Ascertain cause and vulnerabilities exploited - Identify additional response activities, if necessary - Evidence preservation and eradication activities to begin                                                       |
| **Recovery**  | - Determine steps to remedy/mitigate the breach - Engagement with law enforcement, regulatory authorities, media, employees, customers and other third parties - Conclude containment and eradication activities                                       |
| **Response**  | - Report on root cause and total cost of the incident - Action any steps required to mitigate risk of a future breach including remediation of internal policies and procedures - Identify investments and activities to help prevent future incidents |

- 
  1. The steps required under each phase are set out in the “Data Breach Response Plan” in the table below.
  2. Depending on the scale and severity of a Personal Data Breach, it may evoke the need for some – rather than all – of the four phases. Phases do not need to be run sequentially and should be prioritised depending on the nature and severity of the Personal Data Breach.

<sup>1</sup> Note: A person should be considered vulnerable where circumstances mean that they are less able to understand the implications of their data being lost (i.e. children, the elderly, or the disabled).<sup>2</sup> **Privilege issues**: Investigations of a Personal Data Breach may involve the creation of documents analysing the Personal Data Breach (or communications about the incident, such as emails), which may need to be subject to legal professional privilege (where applicable). Legal should help the team engaged in addressing the Personal Data Breach to implement appropriate steps to preserve privilege rights. Legal should ensure that the Personal Data Breach is documented (and such documents are disseminated) based on its advice.

<sup>2</sup> **Privilege issues**: Investigations of a Personal Data Breach may involve the creation of documents analysing the Personal Data Breach (or communications about the incident, such as emails), which may need to be subject to legal professional privilege (where applicable). Legal should help the team engaged in addressing the Personal Data Breach to implement appropriate steps to preserve privilege rights. Legal should ensure that the Personal Data Breach is documented (and such documents are disseminated) based on its advice.

_What legal lessons have been learned during the process of responding to the Personal Data Breach?_

## ANNEX 2: CATEGORISATION OF A PERSONAL DATA BREACH

Personal Data Breaches should be categorised according to one of the following categories. Note that this will involve a subjective judgment and not all of the stated criteria need to be met for an incident to receive a categorisation noted below.

| 5 | Critical | Compliance     | Non-compliance with legislation or regulation likely to result in fines, censure and/or imprisonment                         |
| :-- | :------- | :------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
|   |          | Extent of Loss | Significant loss of unauthorised access to or damage to client or staff data                                                 |
|   |          | Reputation     | Significant damage to our reputation                                                                                         |
|   |          | Operations     | Disruption to key business activities and possible shutdown for up to two working days                                       |
|   |          | Financial      | Is there a monetary value to the damage?                                                                                     |
|   |          | Time/effort    | A critical event that will absorb management time to the detriment of other matters in the short to medium term              |
| 4 | Major    | Compliance     | Non-compliance with legislation or regulation could result in fines or censure                                               |
|   |          | Extent of Loss | Loss of, unauthorised access to or damage to client or staff data affecting various clients or staff but limited in scope    |
|   |          | Reputation     | Significant, but recoverable damage to our reputation                                                                        |
|   |          | Operations     | Disruption to services causing shut down for several hours                                                                   |
|   |          | Financial      | Is there a monetary value to the damage?                                                                                     |
|   |          | Time/effort    | A time-consuming event diverting management time, but not to the detriment of key business matters                           |
| 3 | Moderate | Compliance     | Non-compliance possibly resulting in regulatory enquiry but fines / censure unlikely                                         |

The categorisation of the Personal Data Breach will drive the nature of the response to the incident.

Please note that in the event of a Personal Data Breach that may require notification to a Supervisory Authority, the relevant Data Breach Response Team should draft and send any notice.

## ANNEX 3: KEY LEGAL CONSIDERATIONS IN DETERMINING WHETHER A BREACH IS REPORTABLE.

### Personal Data Protection Regulations

ADNOC Group is typically a Data Controller in relation to the Personal Data of our clients, prospective clients, suppliers and our staff and therefore responsible under the law for ensuring that such Personal Data is kept securely and protected from accidental loss or unauthorised access.

Under the Personal Data Protection Regulations, we are required (without undue delay and, where feasible, normally within 72 hours after having become aware of a Personal Data Breach) to notify relevant Supervisory Authorities within the relevant jurisdiction, unless the Personal Data Breach is unlikely to result in a risk to the rights and freedoms of the individual to which the Personal Data relates. We are considered by Supervisory Authorities to be “aware” of a Personal Data Breach if we have a reasonable degree of certainty that an incident has led to Personal Data being compromised. However, we must ensure that we have implemented measures to detect a breach.

It is possible to notify Supervisory Authorities in phases, where necessary. For example, this may be necessary where full details of the Personal Data Breach are not known at the end of the 72 hour period. If a notification is not made within 72 hours, it must be accompanied by reasons for the delay.

Where the Personal Data Breach is likely to result in a “high risk” to the rights and freedoms of the individual to whom the Personal Data relates, we will also have to notify the affected individuals of the Personal Data Breach without undue delay in clear and plain language.

We are also required to document any Personal Data Breaches, comprising the facts related to the Personal Data Breach, the scope and nature of the Personal Data Breach, its likely effects and the remedial action taken as well as the name and appropriate contact details of the relevant E&C team and the DPO.

### Legal considerations

During the detection phase, we need to carry out the initial information and evidence gathering process in relation to the Personal Data Breach.

As part of this process, we should assess whether any notifications need to be made to third parties for legal, regulatory or contractual reasons. ADNOC Group must notify relevant Supervisory Authorities of a Personal Data Breach, unless it is unlikely to result in a risk to the rights and freedoms of individuals. As a result, appropriate questions must be raised to enable a proper assessment of the risk associated with the Personal Data Breach.

The risk assessment also needs to consider whether any notifications need to be made to affected Data Subjects. A higher risk threshold applies in relation to the requirement to notify individuals than to the requirement to notify Supervisory Authorities – in the former case, notification is only required if the Personal Data Breach is likely to result in a high risk to affected individuals. Additionally, the 72 hour deadline referred to above in relation to notifying Supervisory Authorities does not apply. Rather, relevant Personal Data Breaches must be notified without undue delay. Once a Supervisory Authority has been notified of a Personal Data Breach, it may direct ADNOC Group to notify affected individuals.

We also need to consider legal privilege issues that may arise and should ensure that, if it is possible that legal or regulatory action may result from the Personal Data Breach, documents created as part of the detection phase are protected by legal privilege.
